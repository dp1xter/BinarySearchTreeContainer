## STL-Container

An STL-compatible container based on [BinarySearchTree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree), implementing various [tree traversal methods (in-, pre-, post-order)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal) through iterators.

## Requirements

The container satisfies the following requirements for STL-compatible containers:

- [Container](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Container)
- [Associative container](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/AssociativeContainer)
- [Container with reverse iterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ReversibleContainer)
- [Allocator-aware container](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/AllocatorAwareContainer)
- [Bidirectional iterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/BidirectionalIterator)

## Limitations

The use of standard containers is prohibited.

## Tests
**Google-tests** are connected to the project.
